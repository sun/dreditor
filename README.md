## Development

### Contributing

Dreditor is powered by native JavaScript code.  Simple.

The development process is powered by [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).  Sounds complex, but is trivial!

Setting up a local development environment just takes a few minutes; it's all
automated.
